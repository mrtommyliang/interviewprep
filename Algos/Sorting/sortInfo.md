# Which sorting is best for what situation?
- Insertion sort
  - Used only with a few items and mostly sorted
  - Uses very little space and easy to implement
- Bubble Sort
  - Rarely used
- Selection Sort
  - Rarely used
- Merge Sort (*most used*)
  - Harder to implement
  - Divide and conquer
    - O(N log(n)) best case + worst case 
    - Expensive space complexity O(N)
- Quick Sort (*most used*)
  - Harder to implement
  - If pivot point is not chosen properly, a very slow sort is possible
